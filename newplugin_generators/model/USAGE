Description:
  Stubs out a new model. Pass the model name, either CamelCased or
  under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

  Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
  model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
  specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

  You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
  sketch out a few so you can start working with the model immediately.

Examples:
    `./script/generate model account`

    `./script/generate model post title:string body:text published:boolean`
