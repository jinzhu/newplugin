Description:
    Scaffolds an entire resource, from model and migration to controller

    Pass the name of the model (in singular form), either CamelCased or
    under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attribute
    pairs.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

Examples:
    `newplugin-gen scaffold post`
    `newplugin-gen scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean`
    `newplugin-gen scaffold purchase order_id:integer amount:decimal`
